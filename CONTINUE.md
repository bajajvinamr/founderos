# CONTINUE.md — FounderOS next-step source of truth

_Last updated: 2026-04-24 by Claude (CLAUDE.md drift fixed — composio v3 warning removed)_

## 2026-04-24 — autonomous-loop hygiene pass

- **Shipped (7b7622f):** CLAUDE.md "Known pitfalls" section no longer warns composio-client is v1. v3 shipped in `d8ef5da`; pitfall now describes the v3 auth_config.id env-var pattern. Flake count updated 2→1/1570 (health.test fixed, agent-instructions was not-reproducible).
- **Considered, deferred:** workspace-runtime flake (last remaining 1/1570 under parallel load). Root cause is cross-file HTTP port contention, not fixable via `describe.sequential`. Proper fix = mock the HTTP services (bigger refactor); current skip is the right local optimum. Blast radius of touching test infra across 1569 tests isn't justified by a skipped test no one feels.
- **Exact next step:** Nothing autonomous-safe left. All remaining items are buyer-action (Stripe env, GitHub secrets, branch protection, Loom) or deferred internal hygiene (tickets 004-007, workspace-runtime mock refactor).

## 2026-04-24 — Composio v3 live on prod + 8 toolkits wired

- **Shipped:**
  - Composio v3 client migration (commit `d8ef5da`) — v1 was 410ing, ported to `/api/v3/tools/execute/{slug}`, `/api/v3/connected_accounts`, `/api/v3/connected_accounts/{id}`. Architecture shift: `auth_config.id` resolved per-app from `COMPOSIO_AUTH_CONFIG_<APP>` env vars. Caller contract unchanged. 13 tests pass.
  - Deployed Fly prod + set 8 Composio auth_config secrets + flipped `COMPOSIO_V3_READY=1`.
  - `/api/composio/status` now filters by provisioned auth configs — honest "what's connectable" list.
  - Expanded `COMPOSIO_CONFIGURED_APPS` to 9 slugs (hubspot in list but filtered out at runtime since no auth config).
- **Live toolkits on prod:** slack, notion, linkedin, gmail, github, googlecalendar, googlesheets, googledrive. Deep health green, `composio_ping: ok` 364ms.
- **Buyer-visible behavior:** Integrations page shows 8 connectable toolkits. Each user clicks Connect, gets their own OAuth flow via Composio, returns with an active connected_account scoped to their userId.
- **Auto-deploy still not active** — pushed `d196da8` via manual `fly deploy`. `FLY_API_TOKEN` + `VERCEL_TOKEN` as GitHub secrets remain buyer action.

## 2026-04-24 — multi-company deep E2E + final verification

- **Shipped:** `e2e/tests/multi-company-deep.spec.ts` — 7 Playwright tests walking 5 seeded companies (Khushi, Pred, agnost.ai, Gravton Labs, Little Wins) × ≥3 agents deep-checked × issues/projects/goals + cross-tenant isolation + deep-health-under-load. All green locally (2.4s), public-only profile passes deep-health against prod (20s).
- **Verified handover state:**
  - `https://founderos.fly.dev/api/health/deep` → `status:"ok"` on 5/5 checks (db, table, session, composio v3 ping, sentry)
  - `POST /api/billing/checkout` returns clean `501` with actionable error message until Stripe env is set
  - `docs/HANDOVER.md` accurate (verified against live state)
- **Commits (this session):** 1b2548a (CLAUDE.md) → … → fd9dcbd (HANDOVER.md) → 881f4d0 (multi-company deep E2E). All pushed to `bajajvinamr/founderos`.

## 2026-04-24 — handover doc

- **Shipped:** `docs/HANDOVER.md` — single-page buyer-facing checklist covering (1) verified working surface, (2) Stripe / GitHub / branch-protection flips the buyer must flip, (3) three-option per-customer provisioning recommendation (recommend shared infra, Option A), (4) incident symptom → runbook map, (5) deferred tickets inherited, (6) signed checklist.
- **Recommendation to buyer:** start on shared infra (one Fly app, `companyId`-scoped multi-tenancy). Migrate to `fly-provision.sh` per-customer only at 50+ paying.

## 2026-04-24 — client-handover hardening (this session)

- **Shipped:**
  - **Stripe billing wired** (af2a083): real SDK (`stripe@22.0.2`), checkout + webhook signature verification, 4 contract tests. Needs Fly secrets `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to activate — routes return 501 cleanly until then.
  - **Composio v1 gated off** (70ced91): `COMPOSIO_V3_READY` env flag defaults off. Integration routes now return "not enabled" instead of 410'ing users. Ticket 001 updated with v3 architectural finding — `initiate()` now requires pre-created `authConfigId`.
  - **CI file-size gate** (015b2cf): warn ≥1500 / fail ≥2500 lines. 4 offenders allowlisted (heartbeat, company-portability, AgentDetail, worktree.ts). Run locally: `FILE_SIZE_MODE=all node cli/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs scripts/ci/file-size-check.ts`.
  - **Deployed to Fly**: prod deep health green across all 5 checks.
- **Remaining for client handover (user action only):**
  - Set Fly secrets: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO` (the $299/mo plan), `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  - Create the $299/mo Stripe plan + add `/api/billing/webhook` URL to Stripe dashboard
  - Decide per-customer Fly provisioning vs. shared infra (2-week plan Day 9)
  - Record handoff Loom + runbook walkthrough (2-week plan Day 14)
- **Remaining tickets (code, ok to defer):** 001 (composio v3 — needs fresh session per process rules), 002 (per-file DB fixtures — 2-3 flakes per run), 004-007 (file-size refactors for allowlisted files).

## 2026-04-24 — forward plan locked

- **Shipped:** `docs/PLAN-FORWARD-2026-04-23.md` (4-milestone 90-day plan) + ticket stubs 001–003 for M1. North Star: **10 paying companies @ $99+/mo by 2026-07-22**. Constraint: founder ≤30 hr/week. Excellence dims: self-serve <15 min, agent completion >90%.
- **Pending (tracked, now with ticket #s):** Composio v3 migration (`docs/tickets/001`), per-file DB fixtures for flakes (`docs/tickets/002`), CI file-size gate (`docs/tickets/003`).
- **Exact next step:** Ticket 002 (DB fixtures) is the best next snackable code task — self-contained, no architectural decisions, directly helps CI reliability.

## 2026-04-23 — retrospection pass

## 2026-04-23 — retrospection pass

- **Shipped:** 7 hygiene fixes — see `docs/retros/2026-04-23-retro.md`. Created project `CLAUDE.md`, deleted 2 dead master-targeted workflows, renamed `e2e.yml` → `e2e-manual.yml`, marked shipped plan as SHIPPED, updated `CI-KNOWN-FLAKES.md` with a 3rd flake, deleted local `dev` branch.
- **Pending (tracked debt):** Composio v3 migration (`composio-client.ts`), 3 files >4000 lines (`heartbeat.ts`, `company-portability.ts`, `AgentDetail.tsx`), flaky-test infra (per-file DB fixtures).
- **Known issues:** 2–3 flaky tests per root run (shared embedded-PG data dir), all 17 in-code TODOs are legitimate deferred-feature markers (no rot).
- **Exact next step:** Pick one of — (a) install `@composio/core` and migrate client off v1, (b) begin `heartbeat.ts` decomposition, (c) budget an afternoon for per-file DB fixtures to fix flakes at root cause. See `docs/retros/2026-04-23-retro.md` "Next retro target" for the 3-week review date.

## Prod status (verified just now)

| System | URL | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Fly server | https://founderos.fly.dev | 200 |
| Vercel UI | https://founderos-bice.vercel.app | 200 |
| Deep health | `/api/health/deep` | **status: "ok"** — all 5 checks green (db, table, session, composio_ping v3, sentry) |
| Deployed SHA | `7e9438e` | Composio v3 health fix |

## What shipped in the last session

- **Wave 23A–D:** Playwright E2E, ADRs (10), PRDs (3), QA release checklist, deep health extension.
- **Claude-local onboarding adapter:** Step4Plugin rewritten with 3-option radio (Claude CLI recommended, API key, Skip). Server schema + bootstrap path made API-key optional when `adapterChoice !== "anthropic_api"`.
- **Router fix (regression):** `BOARD_ROUTE_ROOTS` now includes `departments`, `weekly`, `decisions`, `conversations`, `hire`, `plugins`, `audit`, `settings`, `onboarding`, `integrations`. Fixes "No company matches prefix DEPARTMENTS" errors.
- **Test flakes:** vitest fork isolation reduced failures 14 → 1. Remaining 1–2 flakes per run are embedded-PG filesystem contention, not code bugs.
- **Composio health:** v1 API was fully 410'd. Health check moved to `/api/v3/toolkits?limit=1`. Now green.

## KNOWN NEXT TASK — Composio v3 client migration (risky without docs)

`server/src/services/composio-client.ts` still targets v1. Touches 3 endpoints, all 410 now:
- `POST /actions/{toolName}/execute` → v3 equivalent is `POST /tools/execute` (body shape unknown without a working example)
- `POST /connectedAccounts/initiate` → v3 `POST /connected_accounts` (body fields guessed, not verified)
- `GET /connectedAccounts/{id}` → v3 `GET /connected_accounts/{id}` (path confirmed, response fields not)

**Why not done now:** Composio v3 docs punt to their SDK for concrete body/response shapes. No SDK installed (`composio` not in `package.json`). Doing the migration blind will ship silent bugs on real OAuth flows.

**Two options to unblock — pick one:**
1. Install `@composio/core` (or current SDK package), rewrite `composio-client.ts` to wrap it. Cleaner; Composio maintains the shape.
2. Keep fetch wrapper, but first do a manual probe with a real key against v3 to confirm shapes. I don't have the Fly key locally — you'd need to export `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` in a scratch terminal and run `curl -X POST https://backend.composio.dev/api/v3/connected_accounts -H "x-api-key: $COMPOSIO_API_KEY" -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"user_id":"test","toolkit":"slack"}'` to see what a valid body looks like.

**Blast radius today:** `isComposioEnabled()` gates agent tool calls only. No active users are hitting composio execution flows (per cofounder report "connects not working" — which this is). Health green, rest of app unaffected.

## Blockers requiring user action (I cannot do these)

1. **`FLY_API_TOKEN` + `VERCEL_TOKEN` as GitHub repo secrets** — activates the deploy pipeline at `.github/workflows/release-main.yml`. Without them, deploys are manual via `fly deploy` / Vercel CLI.
2. **Branch protection rules on `main`** — doc ready at `docs/ops/branch-protection.md`. Need to apply via GitHub UI: require PR, require checks, dismiss stale reviews.
3. **`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`** — enables sourcemap upload in release builds. Today errors report but stack traces are minified.
4. **Stripe live keys** — scaffold returns 501. Not wired because this is pre-revenue; no rush.
5. **Resend tier upgrade** — when hitting ~30 active users. Currently on free tier's 100/day throttle.

## Monitoring / nice-to-haves

- 1–2 flaky server tests per run (embedded PG shared data dir). Non-blocking.
- Cross-company benchmarks, skills marketplace — deferred, moat work.

## Exact next step

If continuing composio work: install `@composio/core`, replace fetch wrapper with SDK. Regenerate the 4 test files in `server/src/__tests__/composio-client.test.ts` that mock v1 shapes.

If moving to user-facing: E2E runs against prod via `e2e/tests/critical-flows.spec.ts` — worth spot-checking the onboarding flow at 375px mobile to validate the claude-local adapter change visually.
